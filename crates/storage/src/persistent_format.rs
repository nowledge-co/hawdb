//! The engine-wide persistent format version.
//!
//! A database directory is written in many independently versioned codecs
//! (manifests, WAL envelopes, row pages, segments; see docs/STORAGE.md).
//! Each codec refuses versions it does not support. This single integer
//! summarizes all of them for embedding hosts: two HawDB releases with the
//! same value read each other's databases; a different value means the host
//! must carry its data across with a logical dump (docs/LOGICAL_DUMP.md).
//!
//! Bump it in the same change as any persistent codec, magic, version or
//! layout change that makes an existing database unreadable, and regenerate
//! `docs/persistent-format.lock` with
//! `python3 scripts/check-persistent-format.py --update`. CI fails while the
//! lock and the persistent codec constants disagree.

/// Engine-wide persistent format version (docs/STORAGE.md, "Persistent
/// format version").
